# OpenIncident (OPIN)

OpenIncident (OPIN) is an open-source platform for incident management.

Many organizations build their own incident management systems by integrating Slack, Google Chat, or internal messaging systems with their backends.
However, these systems often share similar features and usability patterns, and we believe that sharing these experiences and details within the open-source community can drive greater innovation.

Based on this philosophy, OPIN is designed to make it easy for anyone to build and extend their own incident management environment.
